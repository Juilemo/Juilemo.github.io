    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Staying at home for almost 40 days, I haven’t started my essay writing. It’s about how to increase the influence of the new media(WeChat, Weibo, TikTok, etc.) of the place of interest in Qingdao. I have reviewed some essays on this subject, and many came out about 4 or 5 years ago, so this subject is not a new thing at this moment. But it’s my supervisor’s project, I have to finish it in about 15 days(haha) and publish it within the next semester. So this is an academic matter.</p><p>I don’t have many friends, I suppose. More people are having better lives than me. When going through X(Twitter, the bluebird), I see many people posting their lives and many comments below. I want that, maybe. I want people to focus on me (a little, when I post something, they hit like or comment). I tried to make peer friends on X, but they seemed not interested in me and did not want to talk to me. Maybe I am the one that no one would like to make friends with me willingly. </p><p>I don’t know why I can’t read the whole book. Maybe my mind is quite impetuous or something else. But I can watch the whole movie or TV series. In the past week (maybe two weeks), I have watched <em>Ted</em> (series), <em>Robot Dreams</em> (which is so touchable that I cry for a couple of minutes after the movies), the Japanese movie <em>Monster</em> (directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda, I like the two boys in the film, which are quite cute), <em>Anatomie d’une Chute</em> (a french movie talking about family or marriage issues), <em>Marriage Story</em> (after watching <em>Anatomie d’une Chute</em>, I see this and learn more about marriage life), and <em>Sex Education Season 4</em> (haha I saw a big dick of the main character). The movie I recommend maybe is <em>Robot Dreams</em>, because it’s quite touching, no other words!</p>]]></content>
